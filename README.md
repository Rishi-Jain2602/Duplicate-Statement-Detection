# Duplicate-Statement-Detection
A Website made using streamlit which compare 2 statement and predict whether statements meaning are same or not.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python Libraries - Numpy, sklearn, tensorflow , pickle , streamlit, fuzzywuzzy, distance, bs4

***

## Installation
1. Clone the Repository
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Rishi-Jain2602/Duplicate-Statement-Detection.git
```
2. Install the Project dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Download train.csv.zip file which already been uploaded in this repository.

4. Download two pickle files i.e. modal.pkl & cv.pkl  

5. Download app.py & helper.py file from repository

In the terminal write 

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will open the website where we have to give 2 statements and it will predict whether the statment is duplicate or not.

## Note
1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed
2. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflict with other projects.
3. For deep learning, a laptop with a powerful GPU, a high-performance CPU, at least 8GB of RAM, a fast SSD, and an efficient cooling system is recommended.
4. If you encounter any issue during installation or usage please contact rishijainai262003@gmail.com or rj1016743@gmail.com
